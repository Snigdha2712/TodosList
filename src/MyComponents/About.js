        <p>A Todo List is a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do. 

Most typically, they’re organised in order of priority. Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of paper or post it notes and act as a memory 
aid. As technology has evolved we have been able to create a todo lists with excel spreadsheets, word documents, email lists, todo list apps,
 Microsoft to do and google to do list to name a few. You can use a to do list in your home and personal life, or in the workplace.
Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks 
in the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can 
leave until a little later.
One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list, 
they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused. 
While freeing up space in your mind for other more creative tasks.
When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. This gives you a sense of progress and achievement, something you’ll lack if you’re 
always rushing from one task to the next. If you feel a sense of achievement, it spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving forward.
But that’s not the only benefit of a to do list. Here are a few more:

Improves your memory: A to do list acts as an external memory aid. It’s only possible to hold a few pieces of information at one time. 
Keep a to do list and you’ll be able to keep track of everything, rather than just a few of the tasks you need to do. Your to do list will also
 reinforce the information, which makes it less likely you’re going to forget something.

Increases productivity: A to do list allows you to prioritize the tasks that are more important. This means you don’t waste time on tasks that 
don’t require your immediate attention. Your list will help you stay focused on the tasks that are the most important.

Helps with motivation: To do lists are a great motivational tool because you can use them to clarify your goals. You can divide your long-term 
goal into smaller, more achievable short-term goals and as you tick each one off your list, your confidence will increase.
It seems such a simple solution by putting pen to paper and taking time out of your day to create a to do list, a plan for your day helps define
 your challenges and goals. Preventing time from being wasted trying to identify what is the next most important task to tackle next and even more
  important makes sure you don't forget to do something important.

To-do lists offer a way to increase productivity, stopping you from forgetting things, helps prioritise tasks, manage tasks effectively, use time
 wisely and improve time management as well as workflow.
 To do lists come in all shapes and sizes. It always used to be something that you would write using pen and paper, but thanks to technology there’s an app that can come to the rescue. What makes a good to do list app?
